PROMPT: Compare two machine-learning approaches and recommend which is better for our use case.

ANSWER:
Top findings:
1. Adam combines momentum and adaptive learning rates; often converges faster and is robust. (score=5.65)
2. Second-order methods like L-BFGS can converge quickly on small to medium problems but are memory-intensive. (score=4.75)
3. Transformers rely on self-attention, enabling parallelism and state-of-the-art results in NLP and vision. (score=4.65)
4. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) specialize in grid-like data such as images; efficient feature sharing via kernels. (score=3.80)
5. Transformers scale well with data and compute but can be memory-hungry for long sequences. (score=3.70)

Recommendation: Adam combines momentum and adaptive learning rates; often converges faster and is robust.
